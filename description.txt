Adds the Atom Smasher from the Frackin Universe mod for starbound. I've added 5 diffrent variants, for game progression that can be aquired through normal gameplay and crafting. (I am not, and have no intention of profiting off of this) It has a lot of work to do but i want to get it looking as similar as possible.
